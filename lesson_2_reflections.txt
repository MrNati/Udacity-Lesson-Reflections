What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository, it creates a .git folder which can only be seen when you turn on show hidden files. 
    Also, every file in the repository appears automatically on git as untracked files.
    The purpose of initializing a repository is so you csn have access to it on your git. By thereby be able to manipulate and control
    such file using git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is the preparation area for files to be committed. Only files in this area are going to be included in the commit 
    executed next time. 
    It helps to divide changes in the working directory into several commits, each of which consists of a group of 
    changes that represent a logical change to the relevant files.
